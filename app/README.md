# frontend-for-annaforces

This is the frontend for the Annaforces project, built with React.

**Note:** The data structure for problems has been updated. Problems are now located inside their respective contest's directory, and the `problem_id` is in the format `C<contest_id><problem_letter>` (e.g., `C0A`, `C1C`, `C1000F`). If there are more than 26 problems in a contest, the problem letters will continue as `AA`, `AB`, etc. (e.g., `C1AA`, `C1AB`). The frontend components and routing need to be updated to reflect these changes.

## Data Structure

For a detailed understanding of how problems, submissions, users, and solutions are structured and stored, please refer to the [DATA/README.md](../DATA/README.md) file.

## Project Structure

The main frontend application is located in the `frontend-for-annaforces/app` directory.

## Getting Started

To run the frontend application:

1.  Navigate to the `frontend-for-annaforces/app` directory in your terminal.
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure API Base URL:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend-for-annaforces/app` directory and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` with the actual URL of your backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`):
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_API_BASE_URL
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
